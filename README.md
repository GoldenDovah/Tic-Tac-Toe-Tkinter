# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe game made by the python module tkinter

There's three gamemodes (fourth to be implemented) to choose from in the main menu:

When you select a gamemode of type bot or local, you're prompted to pick the symbol:

When picking to play against another player locally, you'll have full control of the game and be able to tick boxes at will.
The bot's choices are randomized and so the difficulty of winning against the bot varies from medium to virtually unlosable. The score is also registered below the board to keep track of wins and draws of both players:

Clicking back reverts back to the main menu, and clicking retry resets the board. When the game is over, The symbols become gray and the board becomes uninteractable until you click on retry:

To play over LAN, make sure both computers are connected to the same internet connection, then you can get connected after choosing a username.
