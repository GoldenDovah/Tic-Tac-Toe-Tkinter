When picking to play against another player, you'll have full control of the game and be able to tick boxes at will.
When picking to play against a bot, you'll start the game, and then the bot makes its move after you had your turn. The bot's choices are randomized and so the difficulty of winning against the bot varies from medium to virtually unlosable. The score is also registered below the board to keep track of wins and draws of both players:

Clicking back reverts back to the main menu, and clicking retry resets the board. When the game is over, The symbols become gray and the board becomes uninteractable until you click on retry:
